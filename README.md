# Telecom Performance and Voice Revenue Analysis

## Disclaimer

This project was developed for educational purposes to demonstrate Tableau dashboarding, KPI analysis, and data-driven insights for telecom business problems.

## Project Overview

This capstone project includes two main tasks:

### 1. Performance Analysis
- Analyze daily revenue and subscriber data for multiple telecom tariffs
- Build **two dashboards** in Tableau to track KPIs efficiently
- KPIs include: Total Revenue, Minutes of Usage, On-net Minutes, Off-net Minutes, Data Usage (MB)
- Perform weekly and daily performance analysis:
  - Weekly KPI trends using dynamic parameters
  - Top 5 performing tariffs with growth rates
  - Daily revenue comparison across tariffs
  - Cluster tariffs based on voice and data revenue
- Apply Tableau best practices:
  - Filters, parameters, tooltips
  - Color-coding and labels
  - Optimized number of charts for user-friendly dashboards

### 2. Voice Revenue Analysis
- Explore declining voice duration trends across subscribers
- Analyze factors influencing voice duration:
  - Subscriber data usage (MB)
  - Total revenue per subscriber
  - Minutes of usage
- Build **two dashboards** to visualize decline patterns
- Focus on top 10 tariffs with highest voice revenue
- Identify which tariffs and subscriber segments are most affected
- Provide actionable insights for management

## Data Description

- **Performance Analysis Dataset:**  
  Daily revenue and subscriber count for different telecom tariffs.  
  Metrics include total revenue, voice revenue, data revenue, on-net/off-net revenue.

- **Voice Revenue Dataset:**  
  4 months of anonymized subscriber usage history across tariffs.  
  Includes data, voice, and on-net/off-net metrics for decline analysis.

  - Weekly trend analysis
  - Top-performing tariffs identification
  - KPI growth evaluation with alert messages
- Built daily revenue dashboards:
  - Revenue comparison by tariff
  - Revenue proportion visualization
  - Clustering tariffs by voice and data revenue
  - Tooltips for daily timeline insights
- Voice revenue analysis dashboards:
  - Subscriber-level decline analysis
  - Identification of patterns based on MB usage, revenue, and minutes
  - Focused insights for management decisions
